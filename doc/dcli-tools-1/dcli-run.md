# DCli run

### run

Runs the given DCli script.

This command is NOT required.

The recommended way to run a DCli script is via one of the documented [run methods](../#Running-a-script).

The `dcli run` command is provided for symmetry and the possibility that someone, someday, may try to auto generate calls to dcli and having a consistent command structure can make this easier.

Usage: `dcli run <script path.dart>`

Example:

```text
dcli run my_script.dart
```

Which is equivalent to:

```text
./my_script.dart
```
