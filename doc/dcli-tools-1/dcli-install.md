# DCli Install

## install

The install command MUST be run after you activate dcli to complete the dcli install.

```dart
pub global activate dcli
dcli install
```

The dcli install command creates the ~/.dcli directory, expands the dcli templates and adds ~/.dcli/bin to your path.

You will need to restart your terminal after the install completes for your paths to update correctly.
