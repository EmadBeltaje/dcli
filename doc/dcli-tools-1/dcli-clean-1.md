# DCli Clean

DCli clean deletes all build artifacts including:

* pubspec.lock
* .packages
* .dart\_tools
* all compiled exes

You don't normally need to run DCli clean unless you need to get your directory structure into a pristine state \(perhaps before running unit tests\). Normally \`dcli prepare\` is a more appropriate tool.



```text
dcli clean
```

Your scripts are now ready to run.
