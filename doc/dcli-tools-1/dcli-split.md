# DCli Split

The split command extracts a `@pubspec` annotation from a DCli script and writes it to a `pubspec.yaml` file in the same directory as the script.

This is a convenience method as you can perform the same process manually.

Usage: `dcli split <script path.dart>`

Example:

```text
dcli split my_script.dart
```
