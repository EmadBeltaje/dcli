# Add DCli to your project

If you are just using the DCli API (and not the DCli tools) then adding DCli to your existing app is like adding any other Dart package to your app.

From the CLI

```
cd my/dart/project
dart pub add dcli
```

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```
import 'package:dcli/dcli.dart';
```

You now have access to the full DCli API.
