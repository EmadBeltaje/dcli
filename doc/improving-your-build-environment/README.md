# Improving your build environment

When building any pieces of software you invariable need to write software to help you write your software.

* build tools
* testing frameworks
* deployment tooling
* on production management systems

Historically these type of tools have been written in bash, powershell, ruby, python etc.

This is all well and good but as a Dart programmer life would be so much easier if you could write these tools in Dart.

Dart also has some significant advantages over each of the existing solutions.&#x20;

* as single install includes all your build tools
* no dependency hell you typically see with python
* better performance
* ability to deploy an exe with no runtime required
* cross platform

This guide talks about how you can use Dart to improve you build environment and in particular what DCli brings to the table to make your life easier.
