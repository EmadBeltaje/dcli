# Paths

Generating file paths can be a tedious task and error prone if you want your paths to be cross platform.

Fortunately there is a solution at hand.

The good folk a Google have created the [paths](https://pub.dev/packages/path) package for our use.

The paths package includes a number of global functions that let us create an manipulate file paths.

join

dirname

extension

basename

basenameWithoutExtension

truepath
